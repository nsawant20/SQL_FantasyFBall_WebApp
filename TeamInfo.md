## Project Summary

Fantasy Football is a game that allows users to be the owner, GM and coach of your very own football team. Users draft a team made up of real NFL players; based on their on-field performance in a given game, users score points. Points are awarded to users based on various events in a game for a player: amount of rushing/receiving yards, touchdowns or field-goals scored, defensive turnovers and so forth. What makes fantasy sports so captivating is the flexibility of a user's lineup. Fantasy Football allows users to trade players with one another, and also pick up free-agents of the waivers (players that don’t belong to any team). With the game of football being so violent, these tools are crucial when a users team suffers injuries or aren’t performing up to standard. Our project aims to help fantasy users take advantage of players of this fluid system, and make the best player choices for their teams.

Pocket Fantasy Football is a web application that aims to aid users’ fantasy football team performance with personalized recommendations. Users can enter their current teams, receive guidance on their strengths/weaknesses with positional recommendations, and also view key statistics and other information relevant to helping users achieve their goals.
